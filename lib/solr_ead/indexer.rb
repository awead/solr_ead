module SolrEad

# The main entry point for your ead going into solr.
#
# SolrEad uses RSolr to connect to your solr server and then gives you a couple of
# simple methods for creating, updating and deleting your ead documents.
#
# You'll need to have your solr configuration defined in config/solr.yml.  If you're
# working within the Rails environment, it will obey your environment settings.  However,
# if you are using the gem by itself outside of rails, you can use the RAILS_ENV environment
# variable, otherwise, it will default to the development url.
#
# ==Default indexing
# This will index your ead into one solr document for the main portion of ead and then
# multiple documents for the component documents.  The fields for the main document
# are defined in SolrEad::Document and fields for the component are defined in SolrEad::Component.
#   > file = File.new("path/to/your/ead.xml")
#   > indexer = SolrEad::Indexer.new
#   > indexer.create(file)
#   > indexer.delete("EAD-ID")
#
# ==Simple indexing
# By using the :simple option, SolrEad will create only one solr document from one ead.
# The default implementation of SolrEad is to create multiple documents, so fields
# defined in SolrEad::Document reflect this.  For example, no component fields are defined in
# SolrEad::Document, so none would be indexed.  If you elect to use the :simple option, you'll
# want to override SolrEad::Document with your own and define any additional component fields
# you want to appear in your index.
#   > file = File.new("path/to/your/ead.xml")
#   > indexer = SolrEad::Indexer.new(:simple => true)
#   > indexer.create(file)
#   > indexer.delete("EAD-ID")
