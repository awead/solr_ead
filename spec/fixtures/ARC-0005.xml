            <p>Though 
                <title render="bold">EDDIE COCHRAN</title> was only 21 when he died, he left his mark as a rock and roll pioneer. He epitomized the sound and style of the 1950s rebel rocker and was an innovative and highly influential guitarist. He was also proficient on piano, bass, and drums. His short career, spanning only 6 years, produced many hit singles, including “Summertime Blues,” “C’mon Everybody,” “Twenty Flight Rock,” “Something Else,” and “Nervous Breakdown.” These singles inspired many major artists; the first song Paul McCartney and John Lennon ever played together was “Twenty Flight Rock.” Other artists that have covered his songs include The Who, the Sex Pistols, Jimi Hendrix, and The Clash.</p>
            <p>Eddie Cochran only released one album during his lifetime, which was tragically cut short when he was killed in a traffic accident. Artist Gene Vincent and songwriter Sharon Sheeley, who was Cochran’s fiancé, were also injured in the accident. With his death, Cochran achieved iconic status with many generations of rock and rollers, and his legacy and influence can still be seen and heard today.</p>

            <p>Bruce C. Blake founded the 
                <title render="bold">EDDIE COCHRAN HISTORICAL ORGANIZATION</title> in 1990 in Cochran’s hometown of Alberta Lea, Minnesota. A bill collector by trade, Blake was 26 years old when he formed the organization, with the objective of honoring Eddie Cochran and promoting his music in the Alberta Lea area. Most local people were unaware that Cochran was from Alberta Lea before the formation of the organization. Cochran’s family had since moved, and Cochran usually stated he was from Oklahoma (where his parents were from) in order to improve his country music credibility. The idea for the organization’s name, ECHO, was based on the name, EKKO, an early recoding label on which Cochran appeared. The original members of the organization included local individuals, those who liked early rock and roll music, and those who believed Cochran's legacy should be a source of pride for the community. The organization achieved its goals, creating a strong memory of Cochran in his hometown and preserving his legacy for future generation. The organization disbanded in the late 1990s.</p>
